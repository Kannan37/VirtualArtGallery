                <h1>Michelangelo</h1>
                <h1>(1475-1564)</h1>

                <p>Michelangelo was born on March 6, 1475, in Caprese (near Florence) in Tuscany.
                    He was motherless by the age of six and fought long and hard with his father
                    for permission to apprentice as an artist.
                    Fashionable, but extremely jealous of Michelangelo's emerging talent.

                    The public first saw Michelangelo's frescoes on the vaulted ceiling of the Sistine Chapel on
                    November 1, 1512, but some of those vaults you see are not real. The Renaissance artist spent four
                    years painting the detailed Biblical scenes remembered by most people.

                <p> Michelangelo's Angel was produced in 1494-1495. The sculpture is made entirely from
                    marble, and
                    the
                    piece measures 51.5 cm in height, including the base. The artwork is also sometimes known as
                    Kneeling
                    Angel or Angel with Candlestick.
